<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Warcraft: Lordaeron Wars is a strategy game based on the (World of) Warcraft setting by Blizzard Entertainment. Set in the Eastern Kingdoms of Azeroth, you will control one of the numerous races and factions vrying for supremacy of the continent.</p>
<p>Recommended Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player Factions: Human, Hard or Fast AI depending on your preference for the AI play style.</li>
<li>Minor Factions: Fast AI (These are intended to be AI only. This AI plays less optimally so minor faction units will be more likely to attack neighbouring territories instead of turtling on there own territory).</li>
</ul>

<h1>Factions</h1>
<p>There are 6 major playable factions in Warcraft: Lordaeron Wars, each with there own unique units and mechanics (to come).

<h2>The Scourge</h2>

<h2>The Scarlet Crusade</h2>

<h2>Troll Tribes</h2>
<b>Unique Mechanic: Troll Tribes of Azeroth</b>
<p>The player recieves 35 PU at the start of the game to purchase the troll tribes they start the game with. Each Tribe controls different territories and units at the start of the game. A major Tribe costs 20 PU, a medium Tribe costs 10 PU and a minor Tribe costs 5 PU.
<p>If controlled by the AI, they will random the tribes they start with.
<h2>Blood Elves</h2>

<h2>The Forsaken</h2>

<h2>Dalaran</h2>

<h2>Minor Factions</h2>
<p>There are numerous minor factions representing the small indepedent races, such as Gnolls, Spiders and Murlocs. They are all indepedent from one another, and hostile to every other faction in the game. There turn is after all player factions have went and they are capable of producing units and capturing territory like player factions.</p>
<b>Unique Mechanic: Minor races of Azeroth</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Production of units is limited to the production of a <i>production</i> unit and 2 ground combat units, except for the Elemental Conclave which can produce 4 different ground combat units.</li>
<li>All combat units have a PU cost of 3x the cost of player factions.</li>
<li>All units have a stat line of 2|2 except for <i>heavy infantry</i> which are 4|4 and <i>tower</i> which are 2x3|2x3.</li>
<li>All minor faction <i>tower</i> units are capturable, and some <i>production</i> units are capturable which are placed during the game start. These capturable <i>production</i> units represent things like castles or villages that minor factions have taken over that can be repurposed for a player faction to use rather then things like huts or crypts which have no military use. The minor factions cannot produce more of these capturable <i>production</i> units. These are both denoted by a white circle instead of black.</li>
<li>If a minor faction destroys a player factions <i>production</i> unit, it is captured instead and the resulting <i>production</i> unit is capturable by all factions.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>Each faction has access to the same 6 base land units, 1 air units, 3 sea units and 2 buildings.</p>
<p>Each unit is different from one another, having differing PU costs, attack and defense values, support, targeted attacks and terrain types. </p>

<h2>Production</h2>
<p>A territory may only contain 1 <i>production</i> unit and it is destroyed when captured by another player faction. If captured by a minor faction, it is captured instead.</p>
<p><i>Production</i> units can be built on territories the same turn when they are captured and can produce up to its territories PU-1 ground and/or sea units per turn.</p>
<p>A territory may contain any number of <i>tower</i> units but only 1 can be placed on the same territory per turn, and they may be placed on territories without a <i>production</i> unit. The placement of a <i>tower</i> unit does not count towards the placement limit of the territory.</p>
<p><i>Tower</i> units can produce 1 ground or sea unit per turn.</p>

<h2>Landmarks</h2>
<p>The game starts with various minor landmarks placed around the map. These cannot be destroyed or removed, only captured.</p>
<p>Minor landmarks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Farm:</b> These produce 1 PU every turn and can produce 1 unit per turn.</li>
<li><b>Gold mine:</b> These produce 3 PU every turn but have a chance to collapse during the end of a round if they are contolled by a player faction.</li>
<li><b>Pier:</b> These enable the production of <i>transport</i> and <i>frigate</i> units.</li>
<li><b>Port:</b> These enable the production of all sea units.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Support</h2>
<p>A support is a passive increases to another units attack or defense during combat./p>
<ul>
<li><b>Leadership:</b> Found on ground units. Increases a different type of units attack and defense during combat. <i>Leadership</i> from different types of units stack and a unit cannot recieve <i>leadership</i> from another unit identical to it. For example a stack of two <i>heavy infantry</i> units will not give <i>leadership</i> to one another as they are the same type of unit of <i>heavy infantry</i>, but a stack of 1 <i>heavy infantry</i> and 1 <i>ranger</i> unit will give <i>leadership</i> to one another. In another example, a stack of 1 <i>heavy infantry</i>, 1 <i>ranger</i> and 1 <i>siege</i> unit will recieve all 4 <i>leadership</i> supports onto its 3 units as they are from different types of units.</li>
<li><b>Curse:</b> Found on <i>caster</i> units. Decreases an enemy units attack and defense during combat. A unit can only recieve <i>curse</i> support once.
<li><b>Defenses:</b> Found on <i>tower</i> units. Increases <i>back</i> unit types defense during combat. A unit can only recieve <i>defense</i> support once.</li>
</ul>

<p>A targeted attack is an extra attack made at the start of the combat phase to another <i>unit type</i>.
<ul>
<li><b>Retaliation:</b> Found on <i>infantry</i> and <i>heavy infantry</i> units. Targets <i>mounted</i> unit types.</li>
<li><b>Charge:</b> Found on <i>cavarly</i> units. Targets <i>front</i> unit types.</li>
<li><b>Anti-air:</b> Found on <i>ranged</i> units. Targets <i>flyer</i> unit types.</li>

<h1>Territory Connections</h1>
<p>All territories are connected to territories they are adjacent to.</p>
<p>Ground units may only be transported on <i>coast</i> territories.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are territories that have a <img src="Cave.png"/> or <img src="Instance.png"/> map marker.</p>
<p>Cave <img src="Cave.png"/> markers indicate that the territory is linked to another nearby territory with a cave marker via a cave that goes either underground or through a mountain. These are listed below to avoid confusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Havenshire : The Noxious Glade.</li>
<li>Tirion's Cottage : Terrordale.</li>
<li>Revantusk Village : Shaol'watha.</li>
<li>Drywhisker Mine : Hiri'watha.</li>
<li>Circle of Inner Binding : Faldir's Cove.</li>
<li>Dalaran Remnant Camp : Ambermill.</li>
</ul>
<p>Instance <img src="Instance.png"/> markers indicate that the territory is linked to either Stratholme or to Sunwell Plateau. These are listed below to avoid confusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stratholme Gate : King's Square.</li>
<li>Eastwall Gate : Elder's Square.</li>
<li>SZ40 : Stratholme Harbour.</li>
<li>Sunwell Plateau : Parhelion Plaza and Quel'Danas Dead Scar. These two territories are not connected to one another.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Terrain</h1>
<p>Each unit recieves different bonuses from different terrain. These bonuses are determined by the units Terrain Type.</p>
<p>If a territory has two terrains, then then resulting terrain bonus is the sum of each terrain effect.</p>
<p>There are also some terrain types which are used for production, such as Shipyard and don't effect unit values.</p>
<p>All <i>dungeon</i> terrain can produce 2 unit per turn, except for <i>production</i> and <i>tower</i> units which cannot be placed on them.</p>
