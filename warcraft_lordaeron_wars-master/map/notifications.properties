The Lich King was granted vast psychic powers and<br>necromantic magic, and under his will enthralled the countless races of Northrend unto his ever growing undead army with the plague of undeath.<br<br>Though Ner'zhul and his Undead Scourge were bound to the will of the Burning Legion, the Lich King constantly strove to free himself and gain vengeance upon the demons for dismembering<br>his body and damning him so completely. To this end he sought a champion to carry out his will and decided that Prince Arthas Menethil of Lordaeron would be the perfect choice.<br>Guiding the young prince to plunge his soul into darkness with the runesword Frostmourne, Arthas damned his kingdom to undeath.

Led by the Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan, in<br>reality a broken corpse possessed by the Legion dreadlord Balnazzar, they are dedicated to the purging of the undead from Lordaeron.

With the Ashbringer corrupted and the other heroes of the order under his command, the Scarlet Crusade was formed. Purging its ranks of non humans<br>whom in their zeal they became intolent of, they cling to their scattered holdings in Lordaeron.

The Forsaken are led by their founder, Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, the former Ranger-General of Quel'Thalas. Their capital is the Undercity, a<br> sprawling underground city in the royal catacombs beneath the ruins of the capital city of Lordaeron.<br><br>When the Lich King's grasp on his vast armies faltered after the Third War due to the actions of Illidan Stormrage, a contingent of undead broke free of their master's iron will<br> in the fallen Kingdom of Lordaeron. The newly free undead were faced with a chilling realization: the entirety of Azeroth sought their destruction. The renegade undead were rallied<br> together by the banshee Sylvanas Windrunner, who was slain and tortured into Arthas' service during his invasion of her homeland. Under their new queen's guidance, the independent<br>undead known as Forsaken established the Undercity beneath the ruins of Lordaeron's capital. While some Forsaken feared Sylvanas, others valued the security she provided. Many<br>of the free-willed undead however, found a purpose to their cursed existence through the banshee queen's burning desire to destroy the Lich King.<br><br>You control the newly formed free undead, the Forsaken, who control the old capital city and have few other outposts under control.<br>With little to your name, your forces are mostly concentrated around the old capital city of the Kingdom of Lordaeron.</body>
